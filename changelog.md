# Changes
## Version - 1.0.6

## Version - 1.0.5
Have added data for about a month, recorded from my GL553VD laptop. 

1.0.5[^2] will add additional csv files to the dataset. 
Could be a thing to look into visualising it and converting it to other formats. 

2.0.0[^3] Will be the last version and after that the data will be updated at 
[Collections](https://github.com/CHI-Performance/Performance-Collections). 
Will be done to make it easier to branch the data and 
the versioning from the given source it originates from.
It means that the data will be seberated into sub-repositories 
than to have it all collected into one repository.
* Updated documentation so it's up to date


## Version - 1.0.3
Have been adding data for a month, from my laptop. For 1.0.4[^1], will see if i can automate the versioning process. 
* Have created more structure to the dataset and documentation. 
* Updated readme.md file.
* Updated links to download the dataset.
* Removed space from license files. as they are markup files and it will wrap the text automaticly.
* Added directory for netdata data, so it's ready-
* Added workflows to automate the process and make pull request searcheble.
